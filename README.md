# How to become a Minster (mantainer)
The primary way to designated as an minister is to create a work to demostrate a level of master.

It will also typically involve substantial contributions to our projects.

A lot of people get degrees in computer science but this is not required or sufficent.

## Some examples of masterworks
- publishing paper in an ACM confernace
- bootstraping the Clang Compiler starting from no binaries.
- building an operating system from scratch that is capable of running doom.
